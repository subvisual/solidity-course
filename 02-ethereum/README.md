# `integer.sol`

A smart contract that stores a single integer value

# `store.sol`

A key-value store

# `simple-erc20.sol`

A simplified ERC20-like contract. Creates a token with 18 decimal places, and
a balance sheet keeping the balance of each account. Allows querying the balance
of any given address, and transfering funds from your own account to another
one, provided you have enough tokens on your own balance.

Total supply, name and symbol are defined at deploy time.
